    <p>Java is often referred to as a "platform-independent" or "platform-neutral" programming language because of its
        ability to run on any device that supports Java, regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system.
        This platform independence is achieved through the concept of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
        <br><br>
        When you write a Java program, it is first compiled into an intermediate form called bytecode. Bytecode is a
        low-level representation of your code, similar to machine code, but it is not specific to any particular
        computer architecture or operating system. Instead of being compiled to native machine code like languages such
        as C or C++, Java code is compiled to bytecode.
        <br><br>
        When you want to run a Java program, you don't need to compile it separately for each type of computer
        architecture and operating system. Instead, you just need a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) specific to the target
        platform. The JVM interprets and executes the bytecode, translating it into machine code that the underlying
        hardware can understand. This process allows Java programs to be platform-independent. As long as there is a
        compatible JVM for a particular platform, a Java program can run on that platform without modification.

        This platform independence makes Java highly portable, allowing developers to write code once and run it
        anywhere, which is one of the key advantages of the language.
